The [definitive guide to online security](/docs/SECURITYMEMO.md) began as a security memo that we were passing out to our companies and friends who worked in blockchain.

As of April 11, 2019 - We have open sourced it so that others can view, share, fork, and contribute to the security best practices for protecting our digital lives.
 
Please feel free to open issues or pull requests to update the information within.

We are also asking for translations! If you want to translate, we can give you credit here in Github.
